The aim of this project is to develop a door security system that enhances home or office security by using facial recognition and allowing remote control of the door locking mechanism via a web server. The system is built using a raspberry pie model 4 micro controller with facial recognition features and raspberry pie Pico W to handle image processing, device communication, and door control.â€‹
